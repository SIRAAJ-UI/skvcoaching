                                     It has set as a trend to send 100s of students to various medical colleges in Tamil nadu every year and we take pride in the fact that our students are studying in all the leading medical and engineering colleges across the state.

                                    Since educational reformers have brought in new All India Entrance Examinations for every field of higher education, our students are forced to travel across the country to identify right coaching centre to train for NEET/AIMS/JIPMER and JEE examinations. On seeing this, we are struck with the mental agony and as a result, SKV has stretched its paramount wings seeking excellence in the vista of education to rise equal to the changing educational scenario with the advent of SKV ACADEMY.
